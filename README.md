##What's this?
Easysubs is an open source app that allows you to download subtitles from [OpenSubtitles] in a very fast and simple way. I used [electron-vue] as a starter and [Photon] for the UI.

##Why?
I was using a similar app that recently stopped being free. So, that was a good excuse to spend a few hours trying [Electron].
