##What's this?
Easysubs is an open source app that allows you to download subtitles from [OpenSubtitles] in a very fast and simple way.
To start I used [electron-boilerplate] and [Photon] for the UI.

##Why?
I was using a similar app that recently stopped being free. So, that was a good excuse to spend a few hours trying [Electron].

##Download
